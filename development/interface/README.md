## 运动

- [Sportradar Sports API](https://developer.sportradar.com/) - Getting accurate, up-to-date sports data is crucial for applications that offer any kind of interactive game experience. This is especially critical for sports betting apps. Although most betting applications use proprietary data sources to ensure accurate results, other elements of the sports world can be easily offloaded to a third-party API.

## 书籍

- [Open Library Books API](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/books) - Who doesn’t love a good book? Perhaps you’re building an application that provides book recommendations, or tracks reading progress for a book club. Having a data-packed API to grab details about a title or lookup a book via ISBN provides a solid foundation for an app like this.

## 车辆

- [NHTSA Vehicle API](https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/) - What if you could get a list of every make and model of a particular vehicle style? What about equipment and part numbers for a car? Building a custom catalog of vehicle data is even easier when you have access to a huge API like the free one that the NHTSA provides.

## 时间

- [WorldTimeAPI](http://worldtimeapi.org/) - If there’s one thing that always bites developers in the ass its time. We never have enough of it. Not only that, but converting and accounting for time zones and time changes is a huge chore. That’s why you should outsource your time needs to a third-party API like WorldTimeAPI.
